            <div class="data1">Eich started work at Netscape Communications Corporation in April 1995. Eich
                originally
                joined intending to put Scheme "in the browser",but his Netscape superiors insisted that the language's
                syntax resemble that of Java. As a result, Eich devised a language that had much of the functionality of
                Scheme, the object-orientation of Self, and the syntax of Java. He completed the first version in ten
                days
                in order to accommodate the Navigator 2.0 Beta release schedule, and was called Mocha, but renamed
                LiveScript in September 1995 and finally in a joint announcement with Sun Microsystem it was named
                JavaScript in December. Simultaneously, he designed the first SpiderMonkey engine for the Netscape
                Navigator browser at Netscape Communications. When Mozilla inherited the Netscape base code in 1998, it
                included this engine, which was written in the C programming language. It was then changed in JavaScript
                1.5 to comply with the ECMA-262 standard.Eich continued to oversee the development of
                SpiderMonkey, the specific implementation of JavaScript in Navigator.</div>
            <div class="data2">
                In early 1998, Eich co-founded the free and open source software project Mozilla with Jamie Zawinski and
                others, creating the mozilla.org website, which was meant to manage open-source contributions to the
                Netscape source code. He served as Mozilla's chief architect.AOL bought Netscape in 1999. After AOL
                shut down the Netscape browser unit in July 2003, Eich helped spin out the Mozilla Foundation.

                In August 2005, after serving as a lead technologist and as a member of the board of directors of the
                Mozilla Foundation, Eich became chief technical officer (CTO) of the newly founded Mozilla Corporation,
                meant to be the Mozilla Foundation's for-profit armEich continued to "own" the Mozilla SpiderMonkey
                module, its JavaScript engine, until he passed on the ownership of it to Dave Mandolin in 2011.

                On March 24, 2014, Mozilla made the decision to appoint Eich as CEO of Mozilla Corporation.
                The appointment triggered widespread criticism due to Eich's past political donations
                specifically, a 2008 donation of $1,000 to California Proposition 8, which called for the banning of
                same-sex marriage in California, and donations in the amount of $2,100 to Proposition 8 supporter
                Tom McClintock between 2008 and 2010. The Wall Street Journal initially reported that, in protest
                against his coming appointment, half of Mozilla's board (Gary Kovacs, John Lilly, and Ellen Siminoff)
                stepped down, leaving Mitchell Baker, Reid Hoffman, and Katharina Borchert. CNET
                later reported that of the three board members who had left, only Lilly left due to Eich's
                appointment. Lilly told The New York Times, "I left rather than appoint him", and declined to
                elaborate further.

                On March 26, 2014, Eich expressed "sorrow for causing pain" and pledged to "work with LGBT communities
                and allies" at Mozilla. Some of the activists created an online campaign against Eich, with
                online dating site OkCupid automatically displaying a message to Firefox users with information about
                Eich's donation, and suggesting that users switch to a different browser (although giving them a link to
                continue with Firefox). CREDO Mobile collected more than 50,000 signatures demanding that
                Eich resign.

                After 11 days as CEO, Eich resigned on April 3, 2014, and left Mozilla over his opposition to same-sex
                marriage. In his personal blog, he posted, "under the present circumstances, I cannot be an
                effective leader". Mozilla made a press release saying that board members tried to get Eich to
                stay in the company in a different role, but that he had chosen to sever ties for the time being.

                Eich is the CEO of Brave Software, an Internet browser platform company that raised $2.5 million in
                early funding from angel investors. In January 2016, the company released developer versions of its
                open-source, Chromium-based Brave web browser, which blocks ads and trackers.

                At Brave Software, Eich co-created the Basic Attention Token (BAT), a cryptocurrency designed for use in
                the Brave browser. BAT launched its ICO on May 31, 2017, and raised $35 million.

                In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Eich ardently denied the effectiveness of face masks and
                lockdowns in combating the transmission of COVID-19 and stated that United States' top immunologist
                Anthony Fauci “lies a lot,” sparking calls for his removal from Brave on social media.
